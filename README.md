# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Fienna Angeline**

Time spent: **1 hour 30 minutes** hours spent in total

## Summary

**RandomActivities** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes! It includes Hello World, a calculator, Current day, random color generator, a list, and favorite number displayer.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 📅🎨📟
